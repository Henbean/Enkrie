\# Enkrie

This mod adds a variety of units, turrets and blocks for your everyday Crux crushing plans.
Most of these units are very big with some little critters too, the turrets are also all big and heavy hitting.
It is not balanced at all so not intended for campaign use, makes it even more fun in sandbox though ;)
If you think this is kinda epic, star it on github!! Or not, i don't mind.
Based in json.
